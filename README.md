# Python-Project-ASCII-Art-Name-Initials
In this project, I created the initials of my name using Python. 

In this project, I created the initials of my name using Python. Comments were used to denote each variable. The Python project consist of three defined variables: first initial, second initial, and third initial. Each variable has an assigned value that is the equivalent to the appropriate ASCII art depiction of the relevant letter.

A print () statement was used to output each variable whoch resulted in my intials being printed to the console.
